# Automatic-Caption-Generation-for-Images
Capstone project for U-tad

Automatic caption generation for images is an important problem in artificial intelligence. Caption generation shows a relationship between image information and natural language processing. It includes not only understanding important information about an image through feature extraction, but also generating natural language by summarizing key information on images.

For our model we concatenate a CNN and a RNN. We use the CNN as an encoder and the RNN as a decoder.
